README Generator
=================

Introduction
-----------------
A simple shell script that I've written to generate the readme files for my 
personal projects.

Installation
-----------------

Usage
-----------------

If you receive an error saying that -bash: ./readmeGenerator.sh: Permission denied,
you will have to run chmod u+x readmeGenerator first, then run ./readmeGenerator.sh 
again. This is because we need to give the file/program write accessibility first 
before it can be modified.

More Program Options

Software Used
-----------------

1. Linux Shell Script
