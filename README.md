README Generator
=================

Introduction
-----------------
A simple shell script that I've written to generate the readme files for my 
personal projects.

Installation
-----------------

Usage
-----------------
If you receive an error saying that -bash: ./readmeGenerator.sh: Permission 
denied, you will have to run chmod u+x readmeGenerator first, then run 
./readmeGenerator.sh again. This is because we need to give the file/program 
write accessibility first before it can be modified.

More Program Options
-----------------

Software Used
-----------------
1. UNIX Shell Script
